RailBaronHelper
===============

Rail Baron is a great table game by Avalon Hills, but is tedious in that there's a lot of dice rolling and table 
lookups to make the game realistic. This simple program greatly reduces that tedium by simulating the dice rolls 
and doing all the table lookups for you, thus allowing the players to concentrate on the game itself.

NOTE: You must have the board game to play--this program simply speeds the game play up significantly.

First written in Delphi 6, it now compiles in Delphi 2010.
