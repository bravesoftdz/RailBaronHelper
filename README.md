===============

A program to simulate dice roll and do payment lookups for the board game, Rail Baron.

This is NOT a game by itself, but intended to be run from a laptop while playing the board game at a table.  
It simply performs dice roll, city lookups, and destination payoffs needed during the play of the board game. 
This has speeded up game play tremendously.
